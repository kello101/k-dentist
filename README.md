This project uses AI to classify six dental infections—caries, gingivitis, ulcers, discoloration, calculus, and hypodontia—via EfficientNet-B3 and DenseNet121. DenseNet121 achieved 98.84% accuracy. Grad-CAM and YOLOv5 enhance explainability and detection. The model supports early, scalable, and reliable diagnosis.

## Abstract
Early and accurate diagnosis of dental infections remains a critical challenge in clinical dentistry due to diagnostic subjectivity, limited resources, and lack of standardization. This project presents an AI-based solution for classifying common dental infections—caries, gingivitis, ulcers, tooth discoloration, calculus, and hypodontia—using deep learning models trained on a publicly available Kaggle dataset. The solution integrates EfficientNet-B3 and DenseNet121 for image classification, enhanced through techniques like data augmentation, test-time augmentation (TTA), and focal loss. DenseNet121 achieved 98.84% accuracy, while EfficientNet-B3 attained 93% accuracy across six classes. Visual interpretability is ensured via Grad-CAM, and additional object detection is handled by YOLOv5 for caries identification. Performance was validated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The findings confirm AI’s capacity to revolutionize dental diagnostics with reliable, scalable, and explainable tools. This research establishes a foundation for real-time, clinically deployable systems to improve early intervention and healthcare access, especially in underserved regions.

## Results
The performance of the proposed AI-based dental infection detection system was evaluated using multiple deep learning models. EfficientNet-B3, trained with test-time augmentation (TTA) and regularization techniques, achieved an overall test accuracy of 93%, with high precision and recall across all six disease categories. Notably, it performed best on classes with distinct features such as caries, ulcers, and tooth discoloration, with F1-scores nearing 0.99.
DenseNet121, enhanced with Self-Attention mechanisms and Focal Loss, yielded superior performance, reaching a classification accuracy of 98.84%. The model maintained robust metrics across all classes, including hypodontia, which had limited data, indicating the effectiveness of augmentation and class balancing strategies. Evaluation metrics—precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen’s Kappa, and MCC—reflected consistent and reliable performance.
Additionally, YOLOv5 was employed for real-time object detection of caries versus healthy teeth. Despite the dataset’s imbalance (11:1), augmentation techniques enabled the model to deliver high detection accuracy and meaningful bounding box predictions, suitable for clinical scenarios. The model achieved 87% accuracy.

## Conclusion
This study demonstrates the significant potential of artificial intelligence in transforming dental diagnostics through deep learning-based image classification. By leveraging EfficientNet-B3, DenseNet121, and YOLOv5 architectures, the proposed system achieved high accuracy, precision, and generalizability in identifying various dental infections such as caries, gingivitis, ulcers, hypodontia, and tooth discoloration. The use of advanced techniques—including data augmentation, test-time augmentation, focal loss, and Grad-CAM visualization—ensured robust performance and interpretability. DenseNet121 emerged as the most effective model with 98.84% accuracy, confirming the strength of feature reuse and self-attention in medical image classification. Additionally, integrating NLP-based QA chatbots illustrates the expanding role of AI beyond imaging into patient interaction and education. This work lays the groundwork for deploying AI-powered diagnostic tools in real-world clinical settings, particularly in resource-limited environments. Future research should focus on multimodal data fusion, real-time deployment, and federated learning to further enhance the reliability, accessibility, and ethical use of AI in dentistry.
