This project uses AI to classify six dental infections—caries, gingivitis, ulcers, discoloration, calculus, and hypodontia—via EfficientNet-B3 and DenseNet121. DenseNet121 achieved 98.84% accuracy. Grad-CAM and YOLOv5 enhance explainability and detection. The model supports early, scalable, and reliable diagnosis.
